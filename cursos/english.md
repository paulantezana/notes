"When I was seven years old, my mother bought me a radio. At that time, I fell in love with technology and I tried different ways to use the radio every day. It was very fun. I listened to "Cusco Radio" on my new radio, which my mother bought for me. I still keep that radio in my security box as a reminder of that time."
